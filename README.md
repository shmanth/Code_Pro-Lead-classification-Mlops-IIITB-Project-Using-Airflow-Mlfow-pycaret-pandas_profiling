The goal is to create a system that can classify leads based on their likelihood to buy CodePro's course. This system will help to eliminate the inefficiency caused by leads that are unlikely to purchase, which will streamline the sales process. CodePro is an EdTech startup that recently received a significant amount of funding to increase its brand awareness. As a result of its increased marketing efforts, CodePro has received many leads from various sources. However, despite spending a considerable amount of money on customer acquisition, CodePro must be profitable in the long run to maintain its business. The main objectives of the lead scoring system are to remove junk leads by categorizing leads based on their propensity to purchase, gain insights to streamline lead conversion, and address improper targeting. The chosen business metric is L2AC, which stands for Leads to Application Completion. This is because choosing L2P, or Leads to Payment, would drop leads too aggressively. A lead is generated when someone visits CodePro's website and provides their contact information. A junk lead is generated when someone shares their contact information but has no interest in the product or service. Having junk leads in the pipeline creates significant inefficiencies in the sales process.
